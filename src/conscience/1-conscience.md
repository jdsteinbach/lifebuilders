## Introduction

### What Things Used to Look Like (Heb 9.1-5)

> Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.

### How Things Used to Happen (Heb 9.6-10)

> These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.

### What All That Pointed Toward (Heb 9.11-14)

> But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

## What Does a Conscience Do?

### Conscience Processes Information

> 2 Corinthians 4:2 But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.

> 2 Corinthians 5:11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.

### Conscience Passes Judgment

> Acts 23:1 And looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day."

> Acts 24:16 So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.

> Romans 2:15 They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them.

> Romans 9:1 I am speaking the truth in Christ- I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit-

> 2 Corinthians 1:12 For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.

### Conscience Motivates Behavior

> Romans 13:5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.

> 1 Corinthians 10:25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.

> 1 Corinthians 10:27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.

> 1 Corinthians 10:28 But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience-

> 1 Corinthians 10:29 I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?

> 1 Peter 2:19 For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.

## What Can a Conscience Be?

### A Conscience Can Be Good

> 1 Timothy 1:5 The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.

> 1 Timothy 1:19 holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,

> 1 Peter 3:16 yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.

> 1 Peter 3:21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

### A Conscience Can Be Clear

> 1 Timothy 3:9 They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.

> 2 Timothy 1:3 I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.

> Hebrews 13:18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.

### A Conscience Can Be Clean

> Hebrews 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?

> Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.

### A Conscience Can Be Perfected

> Hebrews 9:9 According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,

### A Conscience Can Be Purified

> Hebrews 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

### A Conscience Can Be Defiled

> Titus 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.

### A Conscience Can Be Seared

> 1 Timothy 4:2 through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,

### A Conscience Can Be Evil

> Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.

### A Conscience Can Be Weak

> 1 Corinthians 8:7 However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

> 1 Corinthians 8:10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?

> 1 Corinthians 8:12 Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.

## Definition of Conscience:

A God-given internal tool that processes information about choices you face, gives moral feedback on those choices, and motivates you to choose the right option.

### What a Conscience Is Not:

1. The Holy Spirit
2. The authoritative voice of God inside your head
3. An infallible moral guide
4. Universal
5. Objective

### What a Conscience Is:

1. A gift from God
2. Affected by your sinfulness
3. Fallible
4. Subjective
5. Moldable (next week, we’ll look at a passage that helps us train our consciences)

## Conclusion

For all the good that one’s conscience does, Hebrews 9-10 treats it as a problem to be overcome. It’s not perfect; it needs to be purified; it’s fixated on sins. The Old Testament sacrificial system just placated the conscience one sacrifice at a time. It wasn’t a permanent fix. Jesus, however, provided something much better than a temporary rinse.

> Hebrews 9.11-14: But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.

> Hebrews 10.1-4: For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

The conscience is a gift from God, but it is not our master. Apart from Jesus, it would turn into a domineering, harpy, depressing, discouraging, slave-driver. At the cross, Jesus provided a full & final perfection and purification for your conscience. It still plays its moral-information-processing role in our lives, but it does so underneath the Gospel. This frees us dramatically. Having a clean conscience is not about our performance, our behavior, our perfect submission to its quiet voice, or our human effort. The ultimate purification and perfection of our consciences has already been accomplished in Jesus.
