> Listen to me, O coastlands;
> &#9;pay attention, you peoples from far away!
> The Lord called me before I was born;
> &#9;while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.
> *2* He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
> &#9;in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
> he made me a polished arrow;
> &#9;in his quiver he hid me away.
> *3* And he said to me, “You are my servant,
> &#9;Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
> *4* But I said, “I have labored in vain;
> &#9;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
> yet surely my cause is with the Lord
> &#9;and my reward with my God.”
> *5* And now the Lord says,
> &#9;who formed me in the womb to be his servant,
> to bring Jacob back to him,
> &#9;and that Israel might be gathered to him,
> for I am honored in the sight of the Lord,
> &#9;and my God has become my strength—
> *6* he says,
> “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
> &#9;to raise up the tribes of Jacob
> &#9;and to restore the survivors of Israel;
> I will give you as a light to the nations,
> &#9;that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
> *7* Thus says the Lord,
> &#9;the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
> to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,
> &#9;the slave of rulers,
> “Kings shall see and stand up;
> &#9;princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,
> because of the Lord, who is faithful,
> &#9;the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”

Today's text provides a lovely intersection between our yearly cycle (the penultimate week of Epiphany) and a special annual observation: World Mission Day. This passage focuses our attention on what God's mission is accomplishing in the world and it includes the special epiphany seasonal greeting we've opened our last half dozen services with: "I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth." This isn't terribly special in a certain regard, however: Epiphany celebrates the arrival of the King and what is God's mission on earth but the realization of God's kingdom?

To understand the impact of this passage, we should take a look at what preceded it. God's people are in exile at this point. The last several chapters have combined calls to repentance and faithfulness, with promises of deliverance from Babylon (through their defeat by the Persians) and return to the land. Chapter 49, however, takes this theme of deliverance and throws the doors open wider than Isaiah's hearers could have imagined! This is the second of Isaiah's "Servant Songs," a series of four passages where Isaiah speaks as or about Yahweh's Servant and the deliverance he will provide. The exact identity of the Servant is hard to pin down: commentators have argued that the Servant is Isaiah himself, the nation of Israel (restored and faithful), or the coming Messiah. There's strong evidence for all those conclusions. In my opinion, the simplest solution is to observe that Isaiah moves fluidly between all three identities as he preaches about the Servant: we'll even see that shift happening between verses in today's text.

## Humble Beginnings (1-3)

Isaiah begins by calling his audience to attention: coastlands and peoples from far away. These phrases not merely to Israel's Mediterranean coasts, but to the ends of the world, the farthest locations possible.

Isaiah then gives us three parallel couplets, three pairs of thought that follow the same pattern.

|Preparation|Obscurity|
|---|---|
|The Lord called me before I was born|while I was in my mother’s womb he named me|
|He made my mouth like a sharp sword|in the shadow of his hand he hid me|
|he made me a polished arrow|in his quiver he hid me away|

Each of these pairs starts with preparation: The Lord called me, he made my mouth like a sword, he made me a polished arrow.
Then the second half of each line points at obscurity: in my mother's womb, in the shadow of his hand, he hid me away.

Isaiah's point is this: the Servant is prepared by God for a special task, and that preparation happens in obscurity. The Servant is not famous, not a public figure, not well-known or widely regarded.

What kind of preparation does the Servant undergo? First,he's called by the Lord. Jeremiah uses similar language (1.4-5):
> Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
> &#9;*5* “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
> &#9;and before you were born I consecrated you;
> &#9;I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”

This is where we see Isaiah placing himself into the Servant identity with this somewhat autobiographical language about his prophetic calling.

Second, Isaiah uses two weapon metaphors, but subversively. His mouth is made into a sword and he is like a polished arrow. After a couple chapters of very literal military language (the judgment of Babylon making way for the return to Jerusalem), Isaiah retains that same language while moving into the realm of metaphor. The Servant isn't being prepared to attack anyone with literal swords and arrows; he's not being trained in the violent tactics of this world. Unlike Cyrus (ch 45) who overthrows the Babylonians in battle, the Servant will accomplish his mission without landing a blow. A mouth like a sharp sword refers to powerful words that win; a polished arrow indicates that he (and his message) will be fast and accurate.

After those three lines of preparation and obscurity, we find encouragement (3):

> And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."

It's almost as if God knew that despite such powerful preparation, the obscurity would bring a strong temptation to discouragement.

Note: here we see the meaning of Servant broadened to Israel. By overlapping his own experience with this broader reference, Isaiah is identifying with corporate people of God. There are some practical takeaways for us to consider here. First, ministers aren't in a class apart from the rest of us. Yes, God calls and equips people specially for special roles or jobs, but that doesn't separate people into higher or lower classes. That applies to the perspectives of both the clergy and the laity. On one hand, clergy should avoid the pursuit of power, prestige, attention, or fame. On the other, we should not give in to the draw of our celebrity culture to put ministers on pedestals. Consider how we're inclined to treat the pastors with the biggest congregations, the largest podcast audiences, the most books published. We treat them the same way the world treats actors, athletes, performers, and politicians. Then when scandalous come to light, we reap the consequences. If we insist on putting them on high pedestals, God often grants that wish. But then we end up with *their whole selves* on that pedestal, amplifying vices just as much as any perceived virtue. Second, Isaiah's identification with Israel through the "Servant" connection reminds us that mission isn't just for ordained folks. We might conclude that being called and prepared was something super unique for Isaiah, but he doesn't let us: he reminds the entire people of God that we participate in the mission. We are God's servant, in whom God will be glorified.

## Discouraging Lack of Progress (4)

We noted the encouragement that might have helped stave off the discouragement of being prepared in obscurity, but sure enough, Isaiah hits some low notes in verse 4.

> But I said, “I have labored in vain;
> &#9;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
> yet surely my cause is with the Lord
> &#9;and my reward with my God.”

Recall Isaiah's vision of his calling in chapter 6. God assigned him this ministry:

> Make the mind of this people dull,
> &#9;and stop their ears,
> &#9;and shut their eyes,
> so that they may not look with their eyes
> &#9;and listen with their ears
> and comprehend with their minds
> &#9;and turn and be healed.
> *11* ... Until cities lie waste
> &#9;without inhabitant,
> and houses without people,
> &#9;and the land is utterly desolate;
> *12* until the Lord sends everyone far away.

It's no wonder he's worried (years later) that he's "spent [his] strength for nothing and vanity!"

The second half of Isaiah's complaint is worth paying attention to. On a quick read, it might seem like he's still holding on to faith in spite of discouragement and he is, in one sense. Those words do trust God with the outcomes, but there's more under the surface. In fact, Isaiah's statement that "my cause is with the Lord and my reward is with God" is not merely a positive fix that completely removes his discouragement; on the contrary, he's actually holding God accountable for the circumstances that are discouraging him. The word "cause" isn't our modern "cause" like a purpose in life or a mission to accomplish. It's the Hebrew word normally translated "judgment." And "reward" simply means "wages" or "compensation" (not "something extra" or "bonus" like we use it today). Isaiah is holding God to account to be the one who will judge correctly by providing proper compensation for his ministry. The full implication here is "this is going nowhere and, God, you're the one responsible." Like many other places in Scripture, Isaiah is demonstrating that it's OK to complain to God, to voice our frustration at circumstances that are in God's control and not ours.

We struggle with this. We often find it very challenging sitting with negativity in a sustained way. Certain types of social media use undermine both the reality of imperfection and our ability to sustain attention. Culturally, we are aware of this and we've come up with the label "toxic positivity" to describe efforts to use positive spin to deny the reality of negative situations or to avoid fully processing those situations and the emotions they bring. But here's what we tend to do: we'll say something negative about a bad situation or circumstance, then we feel a need to backpedal immediately by tacking on a positive (often religious) platitude.

* "You would not believe what I'm going through at work, *but hey, this too shall pass!*"
* "Physically and emotionally, I'm struggling so hard with the symptoms of [this sickness], *but hey, God is good!*"
* "I've been having such a hard time with a really important relationship (or with the lack thereof), *but hey, God is all I need, right?*"
* "My traumatic experience feels so fresh and, honestly, it's messing with my head almost every day, *but hey, God works all things together.*"
* "My parent's (or other loved one) death has left me feeling really down, *but hey, they're with Jesus now so that's good for them.*"

Friends, we don't have to "overcorrect" like that. It's OK to frame a legitimate complaint as truly negative *without reversing course to insert a layer of pious-sounding positivity.* Isaiah doesn't do that: instead of undermining the reality of his complaint with some pull-his-bootstraps positivity, he intensifies the complaint by pointing it at God. He says, "this ministry is going nowhere fast; God is responsible for the results."

I do want to clarify that if you're balancing responses of faith with painful circumstances, that's totally fine. YOu are absolutely allowed to feel and talk about both things at once! I'm not telling us to sit around and just be Eeyores with no hope in sight. I am reminding us that avoidance and denial are usually not the best long-term responses to negative circumstances and emotions, and that using spiritual sounding phrases doesn't make avoidance and denial any holier. I'm aiming to communicate grace to you. In fact, let's probe a little deeper. There's even more grace available in the recognition that "God is the one responsible" than just permission to ask God hard questions. Let's consider why we're tempted to avoid hard words and hard feelings or to deny the reality of negative circumstances. Avoidance and denial enable us to stave off a sense of failed responsibility, of personal blame and shame. Because, if we're responsible to fix the situation, and the situation (or our internal state) isn't getting better, then we're failing, and that feels shameful. Recognizing that God is responsible applies grace even deeper than we thought. If we don't have to fix all our negative situations, if we aren't responsible for forcing our emotions to disagree with our circumstances, well then, we don't need to keep avoidance and denial at the ready, do we?

4 obscurity leads to discouragement, Isaiah points the responsibility squarely at God
* Ways we are discouraged
    * Seeing the church’s complicity in earthly power structures
        * Political power / authoritarianism
        * Racism
        * Conquest
    * Seeing the people of God walking in sin (cf Sermon on Mount, Mt 5.21ff
        * Anger, polarization, selective outrage
        * Performative righteousness, virtue signaling, hypocrisy
        * Comfort, materialism, “American Dream”
        * Lust, infidelity, light view of marriage and divorce

## Unimaginable Success of God's Kingdom (5-7)

6 God’s answer to discouragement is more than just undoing the obscurity, but escalating a much more visible universal aim for ministry

The prophet’s lament about the inefficiency of obscurity should come as no surprise, looking back to his commission in Isa 6

Light is not merely Israel, but God himself Isa 60.20

## Conclusion
JESUS HIMSELF - humble beginnings, discouragingly small progress, unimaginable success

Conclude by looking at Mk 4, and Jesus is parable about the farmer who doesn’t understand how the seeds grow, but is amazed at the certain harvest

Also, connect to Mt 9.35-38 and our participation in the ministry
