Today's text provides a lovely intersection between our yearly cycle (the penultimate week of Epiphany) and a special annual observation: World Mission Day. This passage focuses our attention on what God's mission is accomplishing in the world and it includes the special epiphany seasonal greeting we've opened our last half dozen services with: "I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth." This isn't terribly special in a certain regard, however: Epiphany celebrates the arrival of the King and what is God's mission on earth but the realization of God's kingdom?

To understand the impact of this passage, we should take a look at what preceded it. God's people are in exile at this point. The last several chapters have combined calls to repentance and faithfulness, with promises of deliverance from Babylon (through their defeat by the Persians) and return to the land. Chapter 49, however, takes this theme of deliverance and throws the doors open wider than Isaiah's hearers could have imagined! This is the second of Isaiah's "Servant Songs," a series of four passages where Isaiah speaks as or about Yahweh's Servant and the deliverance he will provide. The exact identity of the Servant is hard to pin down: commentators have argued that the Servant is Isaiah himself, the nation of Israel (restored and faithful), or the coming Messiah. There's strong evidence for all those conclusions. In my opinion, the simplest solution is to observe that Isaiah moves fluidly between all three identities as he preaches about the Servant: we'll even see that shift happening between verses in today's text.

## Humble Beginnings (1-3)

Isaiah begins by calling his audience to attention: coastlands and peoples from far away. These phrases not merely to Israel's Mediterranean coasts, but to the ends of the world, the farthest locations possible.

> *1* Listen to me, O coastlands;
> &#9;pay attention, you peoples from far away!

Isaiah then gives us three parallel couplets, three pairs of thought that follow the same pattern.

> The Lord called me before I was born;
> &#9;while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.
> *2* He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
> &#9;in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
> he made me a polished arrow;
> &#9;in his quiver he hid me away.
> *3* And he said to me, “You are my servant,
> &#9;Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”

|Preparation|Obscurity|
|---|---|
|The Lord called me before I was born|while I was in my mother’s womb he named me|
|He made my mouth like a sharp sword|in the shadow of his hand he hid me|
|he made me a polished arrow|in his quiver he hid me away|

Each of these pairs starts with preparation: The Lord called me, he made my mouth like a sword, he made me a polished arrow.
Then the second half of each line points at obscurity: in my mother's womb, in the shadow of his hand, he hid me away.

Isaiah's point is this: the Servant is prepared by God for a special task, and that preparation happens in obscurity. The Servant is not famous, not a public figure, not well-known or widely regarded.

What kind of preparation does the Servant undergo? First,he's called by the Lord. Jeremiah uses similar language (1.4-5):

> Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
> &#9;*5* “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
> &#9;and before you were born I consecrated you;
> &#9;I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”

This is where we see Isaiah placing himself into the Servant identity with this somewhat autobiographical language about his prophetic calling.

Second, Isaiah uses two weapon metaphors, but subversively. His mouth is made into a sword and he is like a polished arrow. After a couple chapters of very literal military language (the judgment of Babylon making way for the return to Jerusalem), Isaiah retains that same language while moving into the realm of metaphor. The Servant isn't being prepared to attack anyone with literal swords and arrows; he's not being trained in the violent tactics of this world. Unlike Cyrus (ch 45) who overthrows the Babylonians in battle, the Servant will accomplish his mission without landing a blow. A mouth like a sharp sword refers to powerful words that win; a polished arrow indicates that he (and his message) will be fast and accurate.

After those three lines of preparation and obscurity, we find encouragement (3):

> And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."

It's almost as if God knew that despite such powerful preparation, the obscurity would bring a strong temptation to discouragement.

Note: here we see the meaning of Servant broadened to Israel. By overlapping his own experience with this broader reference, Isaiah is identifying with corporate people of God. There are some practical takeaways for us to consider here. First, ministers aren't in a class apart from the rest of us. Yes, God calls and equips people specially for special roles or jobs, but that doesn't separate people into higher or lower classes. That applies to the perspectives of both the clergy and the laity. On one hand, clergy should avoid the pursuit of power, prestige, attention, or fame. On the other, we should not give in to the draw of our celebrity culture to put ministers on pedestals. Consider how we're inclined to treat the pastors with the biggest congregations, the largest podcast audiences, the most books published. We treat them the same way the world treats actors, athletes, performers, and politicians. Then when scandalous come to light, we reap the consequences. If we insist on putting them on high pedestals, God often grants that wish. But then we end up with *their whole selves* on that pedestal, amplifying vices just as much as any perceived virtue. Second, Isaiah's identification with Israel through the "Servant" connection reminds us that mission isn't just for ordained folks. We might conclude that being called and prepared was something super unique for Isaiah, but he doesn't let us: he reminds the entire people of God that we participate in the mission. We are God's servant, in whom God will be glorified.

## Discouraging Lack of Progress (4)

We noted the encouragement that might have helped stave off the discouragement of being prepared in obscurity, but sure enough, Isaiah hits some low notes in verse 4.

> *4* But I said, “I have labored in vain;
> &#9;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
> yet surely my cause is with the Lord
> &#9;and my reward with my God.”

Recall Isaiah's vision of his calling in chapter 6. God assigned him this ministry:

> Make the mind of this people dull,
> &#9;and stop their ears,
> &#9;and shut their eyes,
> so that they may not look with their eyes
> &#9;and listen with their ears
> and comprehend with their minds
> &#9;and turn and be healed.
> *11* ... Until cities lie waste
> &#9;without inhabitant,
> and houses without people,
> &#9;and the land is utterly desolate;
> *12* until the Lord sends everyone far away.

It's no wonder he's worried (years later) that he's "spent [his] strength for nothing and vanity!"

The second half of Isaiah's complaint is worth paying attention to. On a quick read, it might seem like he's still holding on to faith in spite of discouragement and he is, in one sense. Those words do trust God with the outcomes, but there's more under the surface. In fact, Isaiah's statement that "my cause is with the Lord and my reward is with God" is not merely a positive fix that completely removes his discouragement; on the contrary, he's actually holding God accountable for the circumstances that are discouraging him. The word "cause" isn't our modern "cause" like a purpose in life or a mission to accomplish. It's the Hebrew word normally translated "judgment." And "reward" simply means "wages" or "compensation" (not "something extra" or "bonus" like we use it today). Isaiah is holding God to account to be the one who will judge correctly by providing proper compensation for his ministry. The full implication here is "this is going nowhere and, God, you're the one responsible." Like many other places in Scripture, Isaiah is demonstrating that it's OK to complain to God, to voice our frustration at circumstances that are in God's control and not ours.

*start cut?*

We struggle with this. We often find it very challenging sitting with negativity in a sustained way. Certain types of social media use undermine both the reality of imperfection and our ability to sustain attention. Culturally, we are aware of this and we've come up with the label "toxic positivity" to describe efforts to use positive spin to deny the reality of negative situations or to avoid fully processing those situations and the emotions they bring. But here's what we tend to do: we'll say something negative about a bad situation or circumstance, then we feel a need to backpedal immediately by tacking on a positive (often religious) platitude.

* "You would not believe what I'm going through at work, *but hey, this too shall pass!*"
* "Physically and emotionally, I'm struggling so hard with the symptoms of [this sickness], *but hey, God is good!*"
* "I've been having such a hard time with a really important relationship (or with the lack thereof), *but hey, God is all I need, right?*"
* "My traumatic experience feels so fresh and, honestly, it's messing with my head almost every day, *but hey, God works all things together.*"
* "My parent's (or other loved one) death has left me feeling really down, *but hey, they're with Jesus now so that's good for them.*"

Friends, we don't have to "overcorrect" like that. It's OK to frame a legitimate complaint as truly negative *without reversing course to insert a layer of pious-sounding positivity.* Isaiah doesn't do that: instead of undermining the reality of his complaint with some pull-his-bootstraps positivity, he intensifies the complaint by pointing it at God. He says, "this ministry is going nowhere fast; God is responsible for the results."

I do want to clarify that if you're balancing responses of faith with painful circumstances, that's totally fine. YOu are absolutely allowed to feel and talk about both things at once! I'm not telling us to sit around and just be Eeyores with no hope in sight. I am reminding us that avoidance and denial are usually not the best long-term responses to negative circumstances and emotions, and that using spiritual sounding phrases doesn't make avoidance and denial any holier. I'm aiming to communicate grace to you. In fact, let's probe a little deeper. There's even more grace available in the recognition that "God is the one responsible" than just permission to ask God hard questions. Let's consider why we're tempted to avoid hard words and hard feelings or to deny the reality of negative circumstances. Avoidance and denial enable us to stave off a sense of failed responsibility, of personal blame and shame. Because, if we're responsible to fix the situation, and the situation (or our internal state) isn't getting better, then we're failing, and that feels shameful. Recognizing that God is responsible applies grace even deeper than we thought. If we don't have to fix all our negative situations, if we aren't responsible for forcing our emotions to disagree with our circumstances, well then, we don't need to keep avoidance and denial at the ready, do we?

*end cut*

Where are the areas we're discouraged in our participation in God's mission?

Like Isaiah, we may feel that so much time is elapsing and so little progress is visible. We may look at a years invested in a relationship or ministry and feel like we too have spent our strength for nothing and vanity.

We may feel frustration at seeing the Church at large abandoning its role in God's mission. If we look at Christendom today, we see swathes of the Church prioritizing loyalty to earthly power structures, complicit in political power-brokering, authoritarianism, systemic racism, or other oppressive endeavors. This was Isaiah's world too! Repeatedly, he calls God's people to repent of oppression:

* "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow" (1.17)
* "Ah, you who make iniquitous decrees, who write oppressive statutes, to turn aside the needy from justice  and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be your spoil, and that you may make the orphans your prey! What will you do on the day of punishment, in the calamity that will come from far away?" (10.1-3)
* "Thus says the Holy One of Israel: Because you reject this word, and put your trust in oppression and deceit, and rely on them; therefore this iniquity shall become for you like a break in a high wall, bulging out, and about to collapse, whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant." (30.12-13)
* "Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?\ Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers." (58.3)
* "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?" (58.6)
* "The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners." (61.1)

Or perhaps, we're frustrated at the lack of mission progress that comes from the people of God walking in sin. We're far too quick to engage in mission-undermining activities like:

* Angry, polarization, selective outrage
* Performative righteousness, virtue signaling, hypocrisy
* Comfort, materialism, “American Dream”
* Lust, infidelity, flippant treatment of marriage and divorce

These vices, by the way, are exactly the areas of kingdom ethics in which Jesus instructs his followers during his Sermon on the Mount. Jordan's sermon last week prepared us to consider "Gospel goodness" in contrast to those exact tempations.

This negative focus is not to say that the God's mission isn't visibly successful at all. No, there are places (especially once we take our focus off of Western nations) where the Gospel is running, the Kingdom is flourishing, and God's mission is succeeding. But, our local reality still stands, and frankly there is a lot we could choose to be discouraged about when it comes to God's mission. Isaiah models our response to that discouragement. Tell God what you see and share your frustrations. While you do that, keep in mind that God is the one responsible for the mission. Let that truth rest in tension with the frustration; don't let either override the other, but sit with the reality of both slow progress and God's responsibility.

## Unimaginable Success of God's Kingdom (5-7)

So we started with Isaiah's preparation through obscurity and we saw how that translated into a discouragingly slow progress for his mission. Now, let's consider God’s answer to that discouragement. God doesn't answer by merely overcoming the obscurity, or by giving Isaiah's mission success within Judah. Instead God escalates with a promise of a truly universal scope for ministry. It's in these final words that we see the Servant as Messiah layer shining most clearly.

> *5* And now the Lord says,
> &#9;who formed me in the womb to be his servant,
> to bring Jacob back to him,
> &#9;and that Israel might be gathered to him,
> for I am honored in the sight of the Lord,
> &#9;and my God has become my strength—
> *6* he says,
> “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
> &#9;to raise up the tribes of Jacob
> &#9;and to restore the survivors of Israel;
> I will give you as a light to the nations,
> &#9;that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”
> *7* Thus says the Lord,
> &#9;the Redeemer of Israel and his Holy One,
> to one deeply despised, abhorred by the nations,
> &#9;the slave of rulers,
> “Kings shall see and stand up;
> &#9;princes, and they shall prostrate themselves,
> because of the Lord, who is faithful,
> &#9;the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”

There's a lot to unpack here, and for the sake of time, we won't go through it phrase-by-phrase, but I want to highlight some features. First, Isaiah "preaches to himself" a bit. He interrupts his own "Thus says the Lord" with a few lines recalling his own obscure preparation. Only now, he's shifting: now "formed in the womb" isn't parallel to "hidden away" (like it was in vs 2); now his focus is on the real purpose of that preparation. In Isaiah's mind, he's replacing "make the mind of this people dull, stop their ears, shut their eyes,
so that they may not ... turn and be healed" (6.10) with "I'm bringing God's people back to God and that calling is an honor." We're seeing Isaiah process his discouragement. He feels what he feels and those feelings are real, and also feelings are like a tunnel and he's moving through them, not parking in them.

Now we get to God's answer to Isaiah's complaint. God isn't just answering the exact details of the complaint; the reply is so much bigger. In fact, God's reply responds to Isaiah's pep talk and blows even those words of self-encouragement away. By asking "Is it too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up Jacob and Israel?" God is in effect telling Isaiah, "Look, it's great that you're feeling better about your mission to your nation, but why stop there? I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth." (If that sentence sounds familiar, it's because we've opened our last several services with those words: vs 6 is our seasonal greeting for Epiphany.)

I love the image of light that God is using here. A couple months ago, we began the season of Advent with a call to "walk in the light of the Lord" (Isa 2.5) by following Jesus, the Light of the World. In chapter 9, Isaiah proclaims that "people who walked in darkness have seen a great light." If we skip to the end of Isaiah's ministry, we find in chapter 60 that the Light God promises isn't merely a human prophet, or even God's people successfully on mission. The light of the nations is God:

> *19* The sun shall be no more
> &#9;your light by day,
> nor for brightness shall the moon
> &#9;give light to you by night;
> but the Lord will be your everlasting light,
> &#9;and your God will be your glory.
> *20* Your sun shall no more go down,
> &#9;nor your moon withdraw itself;
> for the Lord will be your everlasting light,
> &#9;and your days of mourning shall be ended.
> *21* Your people shall all be righteous;
> &#9;they shall possess the land for ever,
> the shoot of my planting, the work of my hands,
> &#9;that I might be glorified.

Isaiah is looking forward to the same end of the world that John's visions revealed in Revelation 21. Let's be captivated by the mission that God is pursuing, the mission that Isaiah played a part in in his day, the mission that the Messiah would one day take up, the mission that we participate in today. This mission isn't merely local, regional, or even national. God is the light of the nations, drawing the people of God to faithfulness and justice and also drawing kings and princes and countless more to prostrate themselves before God's throne.

## Conclusion

I want to conclude this message by drawing the themes together for a perhaps predictable punchline. Can you think of any other significant narratives in Scripture that began with humble obscurity, little visible progress, but then unimaginable success? Perhaps a prophet from backwater Nazareth, despised and by his own people, executed like a criminal while a mere handful of followers even observed, but who was himself the very light of the world, drawing all people to himself, and taking his life up again to sit at God's heavenly throne till the mission is fully accomplished?

_Quick side note: we're conditioned to think that Old Testament prophecy usually looks like a specific prediction that Jesus fulfilled by some detail of his life, creating some kind of logical proof for his divine identity. While some OT passage do appear to work that way, it's not the primary way Jesus fulfills Scripture, and it comes with the danger of letting us forget how those prophecies were meaningful to their first audience. What we've seen happen in this text is Isaiah processing his own situation with God and recording those details about his own life and ministry and God's response in a way that taught God's people what to expect from God's mission. Jesus fulfills this chapter, not by "making a prediction come true," but by embodying the same conditions that Isaiah wrestled through and by embodying the same truths about God that Isaiah (and the people) needed to learn. Jesus fulfills all the Law and the Prophets, not just a set of isolated verses that fit a "prediction -> come true" formula._

Jesus takes this mission of God and makes it more concrete and tangible. Isaiah 49 gives us a giant lofty motivating vision about light to the nations and salvation to the ends of the earth. Jesus gives us the gospel, the good news, teaching both its message and its life-changing effects. If this were a corporation we might see Isaiah's words as a vision statement, and Jesus' teaching as somewhere between a mission statement and some SMART goals. But let's ask ourselves, practically, where do we fit in? What immediate actions can we take to participate in the mission? Jesus taught to pray for harvest workers to be sent into world, and surprise, he meant for us to pray and to be God's answer to our own prayer. So let's devote our resources to the mission. Have money? Donate some. Give to Advent. (I can say that with no worries about an alleged conflict of interest since I don't draw any compensation from the church budget.) Give to Advent and portions of that donation will be further donated to our missions partners, near and far. We're also allowed to give our money directly to those missions partners, no rules against that! Do you have time? Give that. Talk with a pastor or deacon here and ask how you can volunteer. Sometimes you'll even find a way to serve your time that matches some special skill you have. Do you know people who aren't following Jesus now? Talk about Jesus when you can. I know, we worry that we won't have enough answers to convert people, but doesn't that feel like Isaiah's concern earlier? God's responsible for results, we can just talk. Also, bringing people into the kingdom isn't a task meant to be done by individuals in isolation; the Church works together for that goal. So maybe don't worry about converting someone; be content with inviting them to Life Group or a church service. Let them experience the body of Christ in community and let that our Christian love draw them in. We can let go of a lot of the apologetics/intellect-driven framing of evangelism. If we successfully convert someone's head but not their heart, what's that worth anyhow?
