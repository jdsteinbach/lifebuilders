This is the second of Isaiah's "Servant Songs," a series of four passages where Isaiah speaks as or about Yahweh's Servant and the deliverance he will provide. The exact identity of the Servant is hard to pin down: commentators have argued that the Servant is Isaiah himself, the nation of Israel (restored and faithful), or the coming Messiah. There's strong evidence for all those conclusions. In my opinion, the simplest solution is to observe that Isaiah moves fluidly between all three identities as he preaches about the Servant: we'll even see that shift happening between verses in today's text.

## Humble Beginnings (1-3)

Isaiah begins by calling his audience to attention: coastlands and peoples from far away.

> *1* Listen to me, O coastlands;
> &#9;pay attention, you peoples from far away!

These phrases refer not to Israel's Mediterranean coasts, but to the ends of the world, the farthest locations imaginable.

Isaiah then gives us three parallel couplets, three pairs of thought that follow the same pattern.

> The Lord called me before I was born;
> &#9;while I was in my mother’s womb he named me.
> *2* He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
> &#9;in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
> he made me a polished arrow;
> &#9;in his quiver he hid me away.
> *3* And he said to me, “You are my servant,
> &#9;Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”

|Preparation|Obscurity|
|---|---|
|The Lord called me before I was born|while I was in my mother’s womb he named me|
|He made my mouth like a sharp sword|in the shadow of his hand he hid me|
|he made me a polished arrow|in his quiver he hid me away|

Each of these pairs starts with preparation: The Lord called me, he made my mouth like a sword, he made me a polished arrow.
Then the second half of each line points at obscurity: in my mother's womb, in the shadow of his hand, he hid me away.

Isaiah's point is this: the Servant is prepared by God for a special task, and that preparation happens in obscurity. The Servant is not famous, not a public figure, not well-known or widely regarded.

What kind of preparation does the Servant undergo? Broadly, he's called by God. Isaiah gets into specifics with two weapon metaphors. His mouth is made into a sword and he is like a polished arrow. After a couple chapters of very literal military language (Cyrus leading the Persians to overthrow Babylon making way for the return to Jerusalem), Isaiah retains that same language but moves it into the realm of metaphor. The Servant isn't being prepared to attack anyone with literal swords and arrows; those are just images. **A mouth like a sharp sword refers to powerful words that win; a polished arrow indicates that his message will go fast, far, and accurate.** These images communicate the power and effectiveness of the prophetic message for accomplishing the mission.

After those three lines of preparation and obscurity, we find encouragement (3):

> And he said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified."

It's almost as if God knew that despite such powerful preparation, the obscurity would bring a strong temptation to discouragement.

Note: in this line, we see the meaning of Servant shifting, broadening to Israel. By overlapping his own experience with this wider reference, Isaiah is identifying with the corporate people of God. There's a practical takeaway for us to consider here. Isaiah's identification with Israel through the "Servant" connection reminds us that mission isn't just for ordained folks. We might conclude that being called and prepared was something super unique for Isaiah, but he doesn't let us: he reminds the entire people of God that we participate in the mission. We are God's servant, in whom God will be glorified.

## Discouraging Lack of Progress (4)

We noted the encouragement that might have helped stave off the discouragement of being prepared in obscurity, but sure enough, Isaiah hits some low notes in verse 4.

> *4* But I said, “I have labored in vain;
> &#9;I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;

Recall Isaiah's vision of his calling in chapter 6.9-12. God assigned him this ministry:

> Go and say to this people:
> &#9;"Keep listening, but do not comprehend;
> &#9;keep looking, but do not understand."
> ...
> Until the cities lie waste...,
> until the Lord sends everyone far away.

It's no wonder he's worried (years later) that he's "spent [his] strength for nothing and vanity!"

The second half of Isaiah's complaint is worth paying attention to.

> yet surely my cause is with the Lord
> &#9;and my reward with my God.”

On a quick read, we see Isaiah holding on to faith in spite of discouragement, but there's more under the surface. Isaiah's statement that is not merely a positive spin that denies his former discouragement; on the contrary, these words hold God accountable for the circumstances that are discouraging. The word "cause" is common in the Hebrew Bible and is normally translated "justice" or "judgment." And "reward" is not "something extra" or "bonus" like we use it today, but simply means "wages" or "compensation." Isaiah is holding God responsible for the justice that includes a proper outcome for his ministry. The full implication here is "this is going nowhere and, God, you're the one responsible." Like many other places in Scripture, Isaiah is demonstrating that it's OK to tell God about our frustration at circumstances that are in God's control and not ours.

Where are the areas we're discouraged in our participation in God's mission?

Like Isaiah, we may feel that **so much time is elapsing and so little progress is visible**. We may look at years invested in a relationship or ministry and feel like we too have spent our strength for nothing and vanity.

We may feel frustration when we realize that **the Church at large abdicates its role in God's mission.** If we look at Christendom today, we see swathes of the Church prioritizing loyalty to earthly power structures, complicit in political power-brokering, authoritarianism, systemic racism, or other oppressive endeavors. This was Isaiah's world too! Repeatedly, he calls God's people to repent of oppression:

* "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow" (1.17)
* "Ah, you who make iniquitous decrees, who write oppressive statutes, to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right... What will you do on the day of punishment, in the calamity that will come from far away?" (10.1-3)
* "Why do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?"\
"Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers." (58.3)
* "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?" (58.6)
* "The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners." (61.1)

Or perhaps, we're frustrated at the lack of mission progress that comes when **the people of God harm the kingdom by walking in sin.** We're far too quick to engage in mission-undermining activities like:

* Angry words, polarization, selective outrage
* Performative righteousness, virtue signaling, hypocrisy
* Comfort, materialism, “American Dream”
* Lust, infidelity, flippant treatment of marriage and divorce

These vices, by the way, are exactly the areas of kingdom ethics in which Jesus instructs his followers during his Sermon on the Mount. Jordan's sermon last week prepared us to consider "Gospel goodness" in those exact areas of temptation.

This negative focus is not to say that the God's mission isn't visibly successful at all. No, there are places (especially once we take our focus off of Western nations) where the Gospel is running, the Kingdom is flourishing, and God's mission is succeeding. But, our local reality still stands, and there is a lot we could be discouraged about when it comes to God's mission. Like Isaiah, we can tell God what we see and share our frustrations while keeping in mind that God is the one responsible for the mission. But also like Isaiah, we need more. We need to hear God's vision for mission.

## Unimaginable Success of God's Kingdom (5-7)

So we started with Isaiah's preparation through obscurity and we saw how that translated into a discouragingly slow progress for his mission. Now, let's consider God’s answer to that discouragement. God doesn't answer by merely overcoming the obscurity, or by giving Isaiah's mission success within Judah. Instead God escalates with a promise of a truly universal scope for ministry. It's in these final words that we see the Servant as Messiah layer shining most clearly.

There's a lot to unpack here, and for the sake of time, we won't go through it phrase-by-phrase, but I want to highlight some features.

> *5* And now the Lord says,
> &#9;who formed me in the womb to be his servant,
> to bring Jacob back to him,
> &#9;and that Israel might be gathered to him,
> for I am honored in the sight of the Lord,
> &#9;and my God has become my strength—

First, Isaiah "preaches to himself" a bit. He interrupts his own "Thus says the Lord" with words recalling his own previous complaints. Only now, he's shifting: obscurity is met by "honor in the sight of the Lord" and "strength [spent] for nothing and vanity" is replaced with "God has become my strength." We're seeing Isaiah process his discouragement. He feels what he feels and those feelings are real, and also feelings are like a tunnel and he's moving through them, not parking in them.

Now we get to God's answer to Isaiah's complaint.

> *6* he says,
> “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
> &#9;to raise up the tribes of Jacob
> &#9;and to restore the survivors of Israel;
> I will give you as a light to the nations,
> &#9;that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”

God isn't just answering the exact details of the complaint; the reply is so much bigger. In fact, God's reply responds to Isaiah's pep talk and blows even those words of self-encouragement away. By asking "Is it too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up Jacob and Israel?" God is in effect telling Isaiah, "Look, it's great that you're feeling better about your mission to your nation, but why stop there? I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth." (If that sentence sounds familiar, it's because we've opened our last several services with those words: vs 6 is our seasonal greeting for Epiphany.)

I love the image of light that God is using here. A couple months ago, we began the season of Advent with a call to "walk in the light of the Lord" (Isa 2.5) by following Jesus, the Light of the World. In chapter 9, Isaiah proclaims that "people who walked in darkness have seen a great light." If we skip to the end of Isaiah's ministry, we find in chapter 60 that the Light God promises isn't merely a human prophet, or even God's people successfully on mission. The light of the nations is God:

> *19* The sun shall be no more
> &#9;your light by day,
> nor for brightness shall the moon
> &#9;give light to you by night;
> but the Lord will be your everlasting light,
> &#9;and your God will be your glory.
> *20* Your sun shall no more go down,
> &#9;nor your moon withdraw itself;
> for the Lord will be your everlasting light,
> &#9;and your days of mourning shall be ended.

Isaiah is looking forward to the same end of the world that John's visions revealed in Revelation 21. Let's be captivated by the mission that God is pursuing, the mission that Isaiah played a part in in his day, the mission that the Messiah would one day take up, the mission that we participate in today. This mission isn't merely local, regional, or even national. God is the light of the nations, drawing all people to faithfulness, to holiness, to justice, to worship before God's throne.

## Conclusion

I want to conclude this message by drawing the themes together for a perhaps predictable punchline. Can you think of any other significant narratives in Scripture that began with humble obscurity, little visible progress, but then unimaginable success? Perhaps a prophet from Nazareth, despised and rejected by his own people, executed like a criminal while a mere handful of followers even observed, but who was himself the very light of the world, drawing all people to himself, and taking his life up again to sit at God's heavenly throne till the mission is fully accomplished?

Isaiah 49 gives us a giant lofty motivating vision about light to the nations and salvation to the ends of the earth. That vision finds its fulfillment in Jesus, the ultimate Servant, bringing in the kingdom with its life-changing ethics. Big visions and lofty motivations are great, but let's wrap up by asking ourselves, practically, where do we fit in? What immediate actions can we take to participate in the mission? How can we devote ourselves and our resources to the mission?

* Do you have money? Donate some. Give to Advent. (I can say that with no worries about an alleged conflict of interest since I don't draw any compensation from the church budget.) Give to Advent and portions of that donation will be further donated to our missions partners, near and far. We're also allowed to give our money directly to those missions partners, no rules against that!
* Do you have time? Give that. Talk with a pastor or deacon here and ask how you can volunteer. Sometimes you'll even find a way to serve with your time that matches some special skill you have.
* Do you know people who aren't following Jesus now? Talk about Jesus when you can. I know, we worry that we won't have enough answers to convert people, but doesn't that feel like Isaiah's concern earlier? God's responsible for results, we can just talk. Also, bringing people into the kingdom isn't a task meant to be done by individuals in isolation; the Church works together for that goal. So maybe don't worry about converting someone; be content with inviting them to Life Group or a church service. Let them experience the body of Christ in community and let our Christian love draw them in.
