## Introduction

### Advent Season

Happy New Years! No, I'm not off by a month and a half. Last Sunday we celebrated "Christ the King" on the church calendar, the final week of the liturgical year. Today begins the church's new year. Welcome to the first Sunday of Advent!

You may have noticed several changes around the building for Advent season. There's a lot more purple - that reminds that we're waiting for Christ, our King. There are more candles too; we light them incrementally (one more each week) as we train our hearts to long for the Jesus, the Light of the World. Advent is a time of longing, of expectation, of waiting for God's light to break into our dark world. In fact, here in the northern hemisphere, we celebrate the light of Advent at the very time where days are shortest and darkness seems to taking over. On one level, we're counting down the days till Christmastide, learning patience by entering the expectations of God's people leading up to Jesus' arrival. This is an intentional practice: by re-enacting the drama of these expectations every year, we train our hearts to expect Jesus to return. That's the second level of Advent expectation: we aren't merely mimicking the longings felt by God's people millennia ago; we aren't just yearning for holiday celebration; we're actively longing for the return of the king into our world! While it's fun to open a little door to find cheap chocolate and count down the days till we open stockings and presents, it's so much bigger than that. By our advent practices, we are embodying our longings. We're acknowledging that the world is not the way it's meant to be; we're confessing that we're not going to fix the world in our own strength (not us, not politicians, not billionaires); and we're focusing our vision on our true hope: the return of the King, the one who made this world good, the one who lived, died, and rose to rescue this world, the one who will finally restore this world.

### Advent Hope in Isaiah

As we practice patience for our king's return, as we train ourselves in longing for the restoration his reign will bring, we're going to spend time in Isaiah's prophecies this year: Isa 2, 11, 35, and 7. Isaiah's prophecies provide us with an engaging and helpful foundation for our hope. As we weigh the concerns that faced God's people in Isaiah's day and see how Isaiah preached hope, our hearts will be formed in hope after that same pattern.

Let's consider briefly Isaiah's historical background. He preached these messages to Judah (the southern kingdom). Israel (the northern kingdom) already formed a military alliance with Assyria to try to stave off an impending Babylonian invasion; Israel was pressuring Judah to join that alliance as well. Judah's king Ahaz was eager to consider that alliance. In this situation, Isaiah’s overarching message that Judah should trust God alone, not human political/military alliances. It’s not much of a stretch at all for us to find similarities, even to empathize with Ahaz and the people of Judah. We too live in a world often driven by fear, a world stricken by war, a world where competing geopolitical forces or political factions vie for our allegiance. To put a finer point on it, in the country where we all live, constant fear of dangerous political takeover tempts us Christians to put our trust in human institutions and alliances, not in God. In each of this year's advent sermons, we'll see varied facets of one big truth: no matter what threatens our security, our only hope is Jesus, our King.

## The Kingdom of the Prince of Peace

Let's turn now to the specifics of today's text.

> *1* The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
> *2* In days to come
> &#9;the mountain of the Lord’s house
> shall be established as the highest of the mountains
> &#9;and shall be raised above the hills;
> all the nations shall stream to it.
> *3* Many peoples shall come and say,
> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
> &#9;to the house of the God of Jacob,
> that he may teach us his ways
> &#9;and that we may walk in his paths.”
> For out of Zion shall go forth instruction
> &#9;and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
> *4* He shall judge between the nations
> &#9;and shall arbitrate for many peoples;
> they shall beat their swords into plowshares
> &#9;and their spears into pruning hooks;
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation;
> &#9;neither shall they learn war any more.
> *5* O house of Jacob,
> &#9;come, let us walk
> in the light of the Lord!
> ~ Isa 2.1-5

As we look at the kingdom of the Prince of Peace today, we're going to look at it on three levels: the prophecy of Isaiah to Israel, the advent of Jesus, and Jesus' ultimate return. We'll connect some threads as we do and see how this anticipated kingdom is the one kingdom of God, longed for by God's people in all places and times.

### Isaiah's Prophecy

First, let's consider what kind of kingdom Isaiah wants us to expect.

#### An Exalted Kingdom

God's kingdom will be established on the highest mountain. Though we don't find the word "king" explicitly in this text, the loftiness of this language can only refer to royal rule. Given the focus on "Yahweh's house," this kingdom far exceeds mere human forms of rulership. Place yourself in Isaiah's day, when every nation or tribe had its own deity and every battle was framed as a contest of gods. This exalted kingdom isn't mainly about the nation of Israel; it's mainly about the Lord!

We modern folk ought not look down condescendingly on the ancient people who lived in a world of competing deities. We're no better, just a touch fancier and more abstract. While we may have "progressed" beyond gods like Ba'al and Ashteroth, Marduk and Nabu, Ra and Osiris, we find ourselves surrounded by competing deities like money, fame, prestige, pleasure, power, entertainment, escape, consumption, and many more. Isaiah's word strikes home in our world much like it did nearly 3 millennia ago in Israel: God's kingdom is established the highest mountain. We can only resist the competing claims of all our modern gods through allegiance to God's kingdom.

#### An Irresistible Kingdom

An unusual thing happens when Yahweh's lofty kingdom is established: "all the nations ... stream to it." Now, normally streams flow downhill; the nations flow up to the highest mountain, however. The draw of this kingdom is so strong, it feels like it reverses the rules of gravity and fluid dynamics! This stream of all nations flowing uphill comes with an invitation spoken by the people of all nations. Those of us who are "Gentiles" are the ones Isaiah's talking about, so this invitation ought to be resounding on our lips: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths" (v3). God's irresistible kingdom is not merely an phenomenom to observe, but a walk, a pilgrimage for us to participate in. It's a life-changing journey: flowing uphill to God's kingdom is "[being taught] his ways and ... walk[ing] in his paths." This journey into the heart of God's kingdom inevitably changes who we are.

One practical encouragement I find in this combination of divine draw and human invitation is the comfort that we bearers of God's image will certainly be transformed into a clearer and more precise reflection of God's image. You may have spent periods of your Christian life striving after change, struggling with guilt at not being good enough. While we participate in the change (it's not a passive transformation that happens to us), we don't have to labor with stress and anxiety about changing ourselves; the transformation is God's work in us and "the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Php 1.6). We can (and should) trim our sails, but the wind that actually moves the boat is God's work.

#### An Upside-Down Kingdom

God's kingdom turns human kingdom expectations upside-down. Mortal kings inevitably protect themselves with military might. Deut 17.16 warns about the seemingly irresistible temptation to "acquire many horses;" 1Ki 10.26 tells us that even wise Solomon succumbed to it. God's kingdom, on the other hand, is built for peace, not military might.

* swords into plowshares
* spears into pruning hooks
* bayonets into trowels
* grenades into garden shears
* shotguns into shovels
* missiles into mowers
* UAVs into ATVs
* tanks into tractors
* Harriers into harrowers
* fighter jets into crop dusters

In vs 5, the people of Israel are called to live in the reality of that kingdom: "Come, let us walk in the light of the Lord!" Isaiah's subversion of violent human kingdoms is sandwiched between two calls to action: all the nations invite each other to "walk in [God's] ways," then Isaiah invites Israel to "walk in the light of the Lord." This upheaval, this flipping the script on human might, violence, and hostility is the walk we're called to. When the nations invite each other to God's house so that "he may teach us his ways," this reversal of violent power is the way of God we should learn and walk in. When Israel is called to "walk in the light of the Lord," this peace is the light that the Lord is shining into the darkness of human rule and reign. This peace-by-design is the very thing that makes all nations defy gravity to flow into God's kingdom. And the humble peace is made to stand out in brilliant relief by exalted location of this kingdom. No one expects the highest kingdom ever to be run in a lowly, meek way, but that is exactly what we find. All of Isaiah's earlier descriptions of God's kingdom (exalted & irresistible) serve this final description. Isaiah twists the plot beautifully and gives us a vision of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace that overshadows and corrects our past experiences and default expectations for human kingdoms.

### The Arrival of the Prince of Peace

Isaiah invited us to "walk in the light of the Lord." As we celebrate Advent and re-enact the drama waiting on God's light, candles remind us that Jesus is the light of the world. In Jn 8.12, Jesus himself claims "I am the light of the world."

We see clearly that the **upside-down** nature of God's kingdom (the focus of Isaiah's prophecy) is beautifully present in the kingdom Jesus inaugurated. In Mt 20.25-28, Jesus directly addresses the violent authority of human kingdoms:

> "You know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will not be so among you, but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many."

As we saw last week in Lisa's sermon on Lk 23, Jesus the king didn't match people's expectations about his power, privilege, or place. By giving his life, he visibly confirmed to the greatest degree possible that his kingdom isn't one of self-preservation, military might, or escalating violence. Jesus, our Prince of Peace, came humbly to inaugurate a kingdom where the meek are blessed, where the last are first, where the greatest behave like slaves, and where the king willing gives his life for his subjects.

Friends, can we walk in the light of the Lord, can we walk with Jesus the light of the world, while still maintaining our natural, default human commitments to earthly structures of power? Can we hold allegiance to both the Prince of Peace, and to governments built on power, war, and violence? Can we embody the ideals of "swords to plows" and "spears to shears" **and** support ever-increasing military budgets? I'm not preaching against patriotism or against gratitude for the blessings people enjoy in countries around the world. I am calling us to think hard thoughts, weigh hard priorities, challenge hard loyalties, and at times, speak hard words. Was it easy for Isaiah to challenge military might in a time when Israel was being pinched between competing military superpowers? Was that a popular prophetic word for him to share? The kingdom of the Prince of Peace is beautiful, so much so that it will eventually draw all nations into its light. But we live in a time of tension, caught in the current of normal human rule with all its harmful defaults, but striving to defy that flow and move upstream to the kingdom of the Prince of Peace.

### The Return of the ~~King~~ Prince of Peace

Having considered the connections between the expectations Isaiah sets for God's kingdom and the kingdom inaugurated at Jesus' arrival, life, and death, and having considered the tension we feel while trying to embody such a kingdom in the midst of default human kingdoms today, let's look forward to the return of the king (or as Isaiah would say, the return of the prince of peace) and see what weight that carries. Do we find the threads woven through Isaiah to Advent continuing on from Advent until Christ's return and eternal rule? (Spoiler alert: yes!)

We can wrap this up neatly by turning to Revelation 21. In it, we'll find echoes of all three of Isaiah's descriptions. We see the **exalted kingdom** in Rev 21.10. John is watching New Jerusalem descend from the heavens, and guess where it lands:  "And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God."

Not only is this final kingdom exalted, it is **irresistible.** All nations flood up its mountain. John has already twice described the chorus of worship from "from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages" (5.9, 7.9). Now in this final vision of God's kingdom, we see that "the nations will walk by its light" (Rev 21.24). That's a beautiful combination of the two invitations in Isa 2: "people from all nations walking" plus "Israel walking in the Lord's light" equals "nations walking by the light" of Jesus the King.

We also find the counter-cultural peace of God's kingdom here. In Rev 21.3-4, a voice cries out:
> "See, the home of God is among mortals.
> He will dwell with them;
> they will be his peoples,
> and God himself will be with them and be their God
> he will wipe every tear from their eyes.
> Death will be no more;
> mourning and crying and pain will be no more,
> for the first things have passed away."

This is the endgame of the reversals in Isa 2. Only in a kingdom where Jesus has repurposed every weapon of war, where he has redeemed every tool of violence and bloodshed, only there can tears be wiped away forever, only there can mourning and crying and pain be no more. Gone forever are all our human attempts at short-lived national glory, at power and subjugation, and at violent victory. In their place, we find tools of provision, contented labor, and godly peace.

This is the vision that Isaiah cast and the conclusion that John saw. In the light of the Lord, in Jesus the light of the world, and in the light of the Reigning Lamb, we find the darkness of the world pierced, its shadows fleeing away to give us a glimpse of one kingdom, one beauty, one perfection: the peaceful reign of Jesus himself. As we practice patience during this Advent, as we incrementally light candles at church and at home, may we walk in his light. May the light of the Lamb show us peace amidst problems, may the Light of the world reveal hope where we've experienced hostility, may the light of the Lord grant us comfort in the face of confusion.
