## Telling the Gospel Story Publicly

Our time with Philip today is divided into two distinct events. In the first half of the chapter, we find Philip proclaiming the gospel publicly in Samaria; in the second half, we find Philip proclaiming the same message in an individual conversation with a court official from Ethopia. As we look at both moments in Philip's ministry, we'll see a few things. First, regardless of the method or format of communication, Philip's message is the same: the Good News about Jesus. We'll slow down and take a look at what the Gospel message was, since it's the same message we re-orient everything around and that we share today. Second, we'll draw some observations about how we can share that message. When we pull out fancy words like "evangelism," "proselytization," "apologetics," or even "soul-winning" for those of us with Baptist experiences, we get nervous. By seeing how Philip tells the gospel story, we'll hopefully remove some of the fears, obstacles, and mental hurdles that impede our gospel efforts. 

First, we see Philip travel to Samaria, where he preaches the Gospel. Sometimes we get distracted by the sensational story of Simon Magus and forget what a huge deal "preaching in Samaria" was for Philip. As we typically note when reading about the Good Samaritan parable or the woman at the well, Samaritans were not remotely well-regarded by Jewish people. At this point, the growing church was still very much a Jewish sect. Jesus was the long-awaited Jewish Messiah; he fulfilled Jewish Scriptures, and he commissioned a dozen Jewish men to share his message. The Samaritans were steeply looked down on, however; there had been a centuries-long rift between Jews and Samaritans. And somehow, in Scripture, we find them responding broadly to Jesus' message. In John 4, the woman at the well brings most of her village to meet and believe in Jesus; here in Acts 8, there's widespread acceptance at Philip's preaching. Perhaps the tension between Jesus (and his church) and the Jewish religious leadership gave rise to a bit of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" among Samaritan audiences. Regardless, the people readily believe and are baptized.

I want to slow down for a moment on the phrase that describes that baptism: "both men and women." The church is breaking down traditional norms about gender. For Luke to note there that women are included right alongside men would've caught the attention of his readers. There's a growing consensus that Paul's equality ideal in Gal 3 was part of an early baptismal liturgy: 

> As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no longer male and female, for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. (Gal 3.27â€“28)

This threefold denial of inequality (ethnic, economic, gender) flows from the same stream where we find Philip's baptisms in Samaria.

Let's pause here and note a major takeaway for us: sharing the gospel is not a matter of hierarchies, exclusions, or superiority. First, consider Philip. He's not an apostle, but he's out there doing some very apostolic-looking ministry. We don't need to be ordained to tell others the Good News about Jesus. Sure, we read in Acts and 1 Corinthians about special Spirit-gifting for and occasionally a vocational minisity of evangelism, but talking about the Gospel does not require ordination, a unique charism, or a specific role / position in the church. We're all allowed to tell the Gospel story! Not on is the Gospel for all of us to share, it's for all the world to hear. Regardless of gender, orientation, identity, political affiliation, religious commitment, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or any of the other markers that divide us, the Good News about Jesus is good news for all.
