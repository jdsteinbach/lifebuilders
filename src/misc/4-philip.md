I wonder if anyone here experiences _glossophobia_. It's one of the most common types of situational anxieties. One study estimated that 3 out of 4 people are affected by it. It's the fear of public speaking. If you experience this fear, there are plenty of avenues for improvement: you might see a therapist or perhaps join Toastmasters. But I'd also bet that some people listening now experience a similar condition, one I've nicknamed _evangelophobia_. That may sound like a silly made-up word, but it points at a very real, very serious experience for the people of God. For various reasons, we struggle to tell others about Jesus. Often fear plays a part. Perhaps we fear mockery from someone who responds with hostility, someone trained in the "new Atheism" (anti-theism, really) of Hitchens, Dawkins, or Harris. Perhaps in a more personal context, we fear a damaged relationship with a family member, close friend, neighbor, or colleague. Or we might fear being embarrassed if we don't know enough, that the person we talk to might raise tough questions or opposing data or a conclusion we've never heard before. So what's the solution here? Try some cognitive behavioral therapy for our phobia? Jump into the deep-end with some exposure or immersion therapy like Toastmasters? Perhaps - God had graciously provided us with a world full of smart, helpful experts on relevant topics.

I want to look together at part of Acts 8 today and ask if Philip's gospel proclamation provides us any help. (Spoiler alert: I believe it will help us.) We're going to focus on two observations in this chapter. First, regardless of the method or format of communication, Philip's message is the same: the Good News about Jesus. We'll slow down and take a deep look at what the Gospel message was. After all, it's the same message we re-orient everything around and that we share today. Second, I'll suggest some practical ideas about how we can share that same message. When folks pull out fancy words like "evangelism," "proselytization," "apologetics," or even "soul-winning" for those of us with Baptist experiences, we get nervous. By seeing how Philip tells the gospel story, I hope we'll remove some of the fears, obstacles, and mental hurdles that impede our gospel efforts.

## The Message of the Gospel Story

In Acts 8, we see Philip travel to Samaria, where he preaches the Gospel. The Samaritans readily believe and are baptized, but what exactly is it that they believed?

### The Authoritative Story

Luke repeatedly describes Philip's ministry with the word "proclaim" (4, 5, 12). This word "proclaim" comes from the Greek word for "herald." An ancient herald repeated the message from the king wherever the king wanted; the herald was just a mouthpiece for the authoritative message of the king (or emperor, or tetrarch, or governor, etc). The first thing to notice about Philip's ministry is that he tells an authoritative story.

### The Royal Story

Let's look at v5 and consider that the word "gospel" ("good news") is part of this "royal" context as well (v12). Like "herald," this observation draws on Luke's Greco-Roman context. The word "evangel" was used in the first century to describe the "good news" that a caesar had come into power. A Greek inscription describes Caesar Augustus with the words, "But the birthday of the god was for the world the beginning of _tidings of joy_ (gospel)." Though he ended badly, even the proclamation of Caligula's reign was hailed as gospel: "When Gaius assumed the imperial power, ... from our city ... the _good tidings_ sped to the others." A gospel is a royal story.

### The Old Testament Story

As Luke continues, he fills in more details. In verse 5, the "message" is about the Messiah, the anointed one, the Christ. The message of Philip (and of the apostles throughout Acts) is that Jesus is the grand finale of Israel's story, not the start of something new. Luke doubles down on this connection to Israel's story in v12: "Philip ... was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Messiah."

The narrative of Israel has filled hundreds of years of stories and scrolls. Without it, Jesus would make very little sense. In the beginning, God made a world and molded bearers of the royal image to inhabit and govern it. In the Ancient Near East, when a king celebrated a victory, he set up images of himself to remind everyone who he was. In the beginning, God creates a brand new kingdom and puts humanity in it to display God's image. We know what happens next, though: the perfections of Eden soon give way to the broken, painful, violent, sin-poisoned rest of the story: the situation we still find ourselves in today. Along the way, however, God has always been present. Not content to let go of the very good creation (especially humanity, sculpted to be the king's image), God works with and through humans: patriarchs, prophets, deliverers, elders, judges, eventually even human kings. Many fail, some walk in faith, most do both, yet God's plan to redeem all of creation steadily advances, generation by generation. Sadly, we find ourselves dissatisfied at the end. At every turn, the people of God failed to live up to their calling to be God's royal images on earth. We turn the last page of the Hebrew Bible, on the edge of our seats, the air electric with anticipation, as we long to find out if any human can actually be the kingly representative God designed us to be.

Philip knows the answer to that question. Like nearly all the apostolic preaching in Acts, Philip proclaims that Jesus is that king. His message is a herald's authoritative repetition of royal good news that Jesus the Messiah is the perfect human fulfillment of the royal image of God. As such, Jesus frees us from our failures to display God's image and empowers us to succeed at showing the world what God looks like.

### Summary

I love how N. T. Wright's summary of Paul's gospel perfectly aligns with the way Luke has described Philip's ministry:

> The gospel "is not, then, a system of how people get saved. The announcement of the gospel results in people being saved... But ‘the gospel’ itself, strictly speaking, is the narrative proclamation of King Jesus. [Paul] can speak equally of 'announcing the gospel' and of 'announcing Jesus', using the term <i>kerussein</i>, 'to act as a herald'... When the herald makes a royal proclamation, he says 'Nero (or whoever) has become emperor.' He does not say 'If you would like to have an experience of living under an emperor, you might care to try Nero.' The proclamation is an authoritative summons to ... 'the obedience of faith'."
> <i>What St. Paul Really Said</i> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997), 45

In summary, this is the apostles' Gospel: the story of God's people has reached its fulfillment in Jesus, the ultimate King, the perfect God-man. They told the story of God's rescue mission on earth with Jesus as the triumphant conclusion. That summary guides us as well: if we find ourselves struggling to recognize the apostolic message in our gospel witness, it's time to recalibrate. [MORE?]

## The Delivery of the Gospel Story

Now that we've seen what Philip's message was, let's draw some observations about how he delivered it.

### The Story Told by Anyone

Let's consider Philip himself. He's actually not an apostle (though he is ordained to a needs-based ministry in Acts 6), but he's out there doing Gospel proclamation. Friends, we don't need to be ordained to tell others the Good News about Jesus. Sure, we read in Acts and 1 Corinthians about special Spirit-gifting for and occasionally a vocational ministry of evangelism, but talking about the Gospel does not require ordination, a unique charism, or a specific role / position in the church. We're all allowed to tell the Gospel story!

### The Story Told for Everyone

#### Everyone, without Ethnic Prejudice

We skipped over this observation in the first section, but I want us to recall what a huge deal "preaching in Samaria" was for Philip. As we typically note when reading about the Good Samaritan parable or the woman at the well, Samaritan and Jewish people were not remotely on good terms. At this point, the growing church was still very much a Jewish sect. Jesus was the long-awaited Jewish Messiah; he fulfilled Jewish Scriptures, and he commissioned a dozen Jewish men to share his message. There had been a centuries-long rift between Jews and Samaritans. And somehow, in Scripture, we find them responding broadly to Jesus' message. In John 4, the woman at the well brings most of her village to meet and believe in Jesus; here in Acts 8, there's widespread acceptance at Philip's preaching. The people in Samaria readily believe and are baptized.

#### Everyone, without Socio-Economic Prejudice

We find Philip sharing the Gospel with "normal people" in Samaria, as well as with two big fancy guys, "Simon the Great" in v13, as well as the Ethiopian official in v26ff. The Good News calls out to both haves and have-nots.

#### Everyone, without Gender Prejudice

I also want us to slow down for a moment at the phrase that describes that baptism: "both men and women" (v12). The church is breaking down traditional norms about gender. For Luke to note there that women are included right alongside men would've caught the attention of his readers, startling more than a few of them.

#### Summary

There's a growing consensus that Paul's equality ideal in Gal 3 was part of an early baptismal liturgy:

> As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no longer male and female, for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. (Gal 3.27–28)

Paul's threefold denial of inequality (ethnic, economic, gender) flows from the same stream where we find Philip baptizing in Samaria.

This applies to us as well. As we share the Gospel story, we need to do so without any ideas of exclusivity or superiority. Regardless of gender, orientation, identity, political  or religious affiliation, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or any of the other markers that divide us, the Good News about Jesus is good news for all.

### The Story Told as Story

Hopefully, by observing that the Gospel story can be told by anyone to everyone, we've broken down at least a couple fears and barriers to our own efforts to spread the Gospel. As a final takeaway, I want us to consider a word I've used at least 1x a minute on average during this sermon. That word is "story." I'd like us to focus on Gospel-proclamation as story-telling and to call out some modern misconceptions we may have about evangelism.

#### The Gospel Is Not Propositions

As Christians who have been thinking about the Bible for two millennia, give or take, we've got a lot of highly nuanced, well-defined, and occasionally overly precise ways of organizing our thoughts about the God we see in Scripture. That leaves us prone to forget the fact that the vast majority of Scripture is written as narrative, as story. The book God has given us really wants us to experience God through story, not to distill our God-thoughts down to a series of mere "facts." I'm not diminishing "fact" or in any way denying that we can know truth about God (and that we should constantly pursue truer and truer thoughts about God!), but I am concerned that if we're content to exchange the Bible's narratives for a list of "bullet points" summarizing "correct theology," we'll spiritually starve ourselves. God is not a doctrinal statement, a creed, a systematic theology, or set of organized abstract truths. Turning the Bible's stories into mere theological propositions leaves us with big heads, but shallow hearts. The Bible tells a beautiful, sweeping story of the God who gets close to us, the God who acts with and for us, the God who enters our experiences, the God who rescues us and enjoys living in relationship with us. The Gospel is that story: all of God's presence, God's humility, God's rescue plan, God's delight in us, that's King Jesus, the fulfillment of all the stories of old, the yes and amen to every ancient promise, the eternal reconciliation of God and humanity.

While I'd love to settle here for a while and consider myriad ways that God's self-revelation through narrative shapes our own spiritual experience and richly blesses our own hearts, I'll stay on topic and talk about how we share this story. Our knowledge of God comes primarily through narrative: the authoritative narrative of Scripture's story and our confirming narratives of our own experience with God. Hopefully, our knowledge of God does not come through mere facts and proofs and volumes of theology. In that same way, our witness should be a story-telling witness, just like Philip and the apostles.

There's a whole apologetics industrial complex in conservative Christendom that's devoted itself to proving things about God and about Scripture. That way of thinking and talking about God thrives on logic, reason, proofs, arguments, debates. Honestly, that kind of apologetics traffics almost exclusively in the currency of Enlightenment rationalism. Modernism (call it Enlightenment thought, humanism, rationalism - the Venn diagram of those labels is more overlap than distinction) attempted to enthrone human intellect and reason. Some Christians have rightly denied that idolatry of "pure reason", while, at the same time, creating a way of talking about God that's inextricably bound (handcuffed even) to human intellect and reason. That kind of rationalistic apologetics is now struggling in the face of postmodernism. Postmodernism rightly calls out modernism's "pure reason" as a myth. All knowing is done by people in a context; everyone brings their own lens or perspective to all their endeavors (even theological or religious ones). I wear these optical lenses so I can actually see things, and all our theological efforts wear the lens of our context as well. While I don't recommend the full deconstruction or subjectivism in postmodernism, I do welcome its critique of rationalistic, merely-intellectual apologetics.

And now, re-enter "story." Friends, if you've felt intimidated by the amount of reason-driven apologetics that seems to have side-loaded itself into evangelism, you're not alone, and you're not wrong. Allow me to commend to you a brief book called _Narrative Apologetics_, by Alister McGrath. McGrath explains (much better than the too-brief summary I just gave) the tension between modernism and postmodernism, and the church's attempts to talk well about God without capitulating to either philosophical trend. He advocates that we set aside merely logical, rationalistic methods of sharing the Gospel, instead share the Gospel through story-telling. He identifies three stories we may find helpful as we proclaim: the Bible's story (God's own narrative), our own stories about our experiences with God, and stories from our culture that reflect and re-tell the same narrative arcs as God's story.

To get less nerdy and more practical, we don't have to memorize logical arguments or a series complicated proofs for the existence of God. Instead we can tell people the stories of Scripture. In fact, we do that every week downstairs with our kids. Through story made tangible, we allow our children to experience God through the narratives of Scripture. Some parents may find catechism helpful in their families, but I'd recommend that the focus ought to be on the real narratives of God's people in Scripture. I don't think adults lack that same desire to be caught up in a story, either! We might repress it and channel it into a TV series or a film franchise, but we humans are creatures of stories. We can also tell our own stories of our experience with God in Jesus; by doing so we testify that our lives make the most sense when we live them as little stories contained by God's big story. Instead of evangelism based on convincing people of theological propositions (true as those propositions might be), what if we told our personal Jesus stories in a way that invites people to actually try experiencing the story we live under? An invitation to church would no longer be an invitation to a single event or sermon, but an invitation to repeatedly experience the big story with us.

The Bible invites us in with this same language of experience:

> O taste and see that the Lord is good; happy are those who take refuge in him (Ps 34.8).

> Hear, everyone who thirsts;
> &#9;come to the waters;
> and you who have no money,
> &#9;come, buy and eat!
> Come, buy wine and milk
> &#9;without money and without price (Isa 55.1)

> The Spirit and the bride say, "Come."
> And let everyone who hears say, "Come."
> And let everyone who is thirsty come.
> Let anyone who wishes take the water of life as a gift (Rev 22.17).

God invites us to step into lived experience, to enter a narrative, to live our lives under the big story. Why not simply extend that same invitation to our family, friends, loved ones and neighbors?
